Unrealistic Fitness Expectations

\<overview\>

Social media platforms have significantly influenced fitness culture, promoting unrealistic fitness expectations that affect body image and mental health, especially among adolescents and young adults. These platforms frequently feature idealized images and videos that set unattainable standards, leading to increased body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, low self-esteem, overtraining, the use of harmful substances to alter body weight or enhance muscle gain, and other significant mental and physical health issues.  As social media represents a continuously growing part of people’s social lives, the images they portray begin to appear normal or expected in real life, even when they are often edited or represent a few individuals who might not carry out healthy or desirable lifestyles. Exposure to almost impossibly fit ideals creates expectations that young people crave to fulfill, leaving them profoundly unsatisfied and desperate enough to engage in unhealthy behaviors.

**Introduction**

Social media has revolutionized how fitness and body image ideals are communicated, often setting unattainable standards. Unrealistic fitness expectations refer to idealized body images and extreme fitness routines promoted on social media that are often unattainable for the average person. These expectations are prevalent on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, where influencers and celebrities frequently share curated and edited content showcasing ideal body types and rigorous workout regimens ({zotero:62IDGPYH}Jerónimo and Carraça). Fitness ideals have evolved significantly, especially with the rise of digital media. Traditional media already propagated certain beauty standards, but social media has amplified these ideals by enabling constant comparison and interaction ({zotero:ZLDAWWCN}Cataldo et al.).

Social media platforms have become integral in shaping contemporary fitness culture, popularizing trends like "fitspiration", which involves posting inspirational images and quotes that promote a healthy lifestyle, emphasizing exercise and diet to achieve an athletic body ({zotero:62IDGPYH}Jerónimo and Carraça). While intended to promote health and fitness, fitspiration often showcases unrealistic body ideals, contributing to negative self-perception and mental health issues among users ({zotero:ZLDAWWCN}Cataldo et al.).

**Dangers of exposure to unrealistic fitness content**

Theoretical frameworks such as social comparison and self-discrepancy theories offer insights into how social media influences body image.

Social comparison theory ({zotero:WUNTXVXT}Festinger) helps explain the adverse effects of fitspiration content. According to this theory, individuals evaluate themselves based on comparisons with others. Viewing idealized images on social media can lead to upward social comparisons, resulting in feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with one's body ({zotero:RL5JV2M2}Perloff). This is supported by findings that exposure to fitspiration images, even with disclaimer labels indicating digital alteration, can increase body dissatisfaction by drawing more attention to idealized features ({zotero:J2EX3D6Y}Tiggemann et al.; {zotero:77PQMW32}Selimbegovic and Chatard).

Self-discrepancy theory ({zotero:2K9EPQ4Q}Higgins) suggests that discrepancies between one's actual, ideal, and ought selves can lead to emotional distress. Exposure to fitspiration content can exacerbate these discrepancies, particularly between the actual and ideal selves, leading to negative emotions such as disappointment and sadness ({zotero:77PQMW32}Selimbegovic and Chatard).

These theories explain why exposure to extreme fitness content, which often includes heavily edited and curated images of fitness influencers, can lead to adverse physical and psychological outcomes.

**Impact on Adolescents**

Studies have shown that young adolescents exposed to fitspiration content report increased body dissatisfaction and unhealthy exercise behaviors. Through qualitative interviews, adolescents described feeling pressured to achieve the "perfect" body seen on social media. The same study pointed out that content on social media is often interpreted through a lens of physical transformation and hard work, reinforcing the idea that fitness and body appearance require significant effort, dedication, and often pain. This perspective can lead to harmful behaviors such as overtraining and unhealthy dieting practices ({zotero:KYPRXYCG}Bell et al.).

Additionally, a 2018 study noted that while some young adults perceive it as a tool for healthy living, many experience negative emotional impacts and vulnerability, with heightened body dissatisfaction and pressure to conform to unrealistic standards. Participants in this study reported feeling inadequate and anxious when they could not match the physiques of fitness influencers ({zotero:NJXPT49P}Easton et al.). Similarly, a strong correlation was found between viewing fitspiration content and reduced self-esteem among young women. The study revealed that constant exposure to idealized body images on platforms like Instagram can erode self-worth and lead to persistent negative body image ({zotero:MA42UCUJ}Goldstraw and Keegan).

While most research focuses on women, men are also affected by unrealistic fitness expectations. Unrealistic standards can lead to muscle dysmorphia and the use of performance-enhancing substances among males. Muscle dysmorphia, characterized by an obsessive focus on gaining muscle mass and a distorted body image where individuals perceive themselves as not muscular enough despite being fit, can lead to harmful behaviors such as the abuse of anabolic steroids and excessive workout routines ({zotero:ZQSBLQZM}Griffiths et al.).

Men and boys are increasingly exposed to fitspiration content that promotes an exaggerated muscular ideal. Researchers found that exposure to muscular physiques on social media is associated with body dissatisfaction and unhealthy behaviors in men, similar to the effects observed in women (Vartanian et al.). Future research should explore the differential impacts on various genders and age groups to develop targeted interventions that address these unique challenges.

**Empirical Evidence**

Several studies provide empirical evidence on the harmful effects of fitspiration content. For example, a content analysis of Instagram posts revealed that a significant proportion of fitspiration images, which depicted individuals with low body fat and muscular physiques, reinforcing unattainable body standards, are highly edited and selectively curated to showcase peak physical condition, which is not representative of everyday reality ({zotero:48YCFXRU}Deighton-Smith and Bell).

Another content analysis of Instagram images revealed that most depicted thin and toned body types, contributing to body dissatisfaction among viewers. The study found that users who frequently viewed fitspiration content reported higher levels of body dissatisfaction and a greater likelihood of engaging in disordered eating behaviors ({zotero:J2EX3D6Y}Tiggemann and Zaccardo).

The psychopathological risks associated with fitspiration content include increased body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and anxiety. Their research showed that the more time individuals spent viewing fitspiration content, the more likely they were to develop negative body image and mental health issues. The more time individuals spend viewing fitspiration content, the more likely they are to develop negative body image and mental health issues ({zotero:ZLDAWWCN}Cataldo et al.).

The link between excessive social media use and body dysmorphic disorder has also been highlighted, as individuals with high social media usage proved to be more likely to experience extreme dissatisfaction with their appearance and engage in harmful behaviors to alter their body image ({zotero:J87BXXZT}Boursier).

**Role of Social Media Platforms**

Social media platforms play a significant role in perpetuating unrealistic fitness expectations. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have algorithms designed to maximize user engagement by promoting content that receives high levels of interaction. These algorithms often prioritize images and videos that feature idealized body types and extreme fitness routines, leading to increased exposure to unrealistic fitness expectations. The constant reinforcement of these images through algorithmic amplification creates a feedback loop where users continuously encounter and engage with content that sets unattainable standards ({zotero:RAAXEATQ}Li et al.; {zotero:62IDGPYH}Jerónimo and Carraça).

Social media filters and photo editing tools allow influencers and users to enhance their appearance, often making their bodies look more toned and flawless than they are in reality. This can involve altering body shapes, smoothing skin, and highlighting muscles, creating an idealized image that is far from achievable for most people. The widespread use of these tools contributes to the perpetuation of unrealistic body standards, as users compare themselves to these edited images without realizing the extent of the modifications ({zotero:48YCFXRU}Deighton-Smith and Bell).

Influencers on social media platforms play a significant role in setting fitness trends and promoting certain body ideals. They often post highly curated and edited content that showcases their best physical appearance, frequently using filters and professional photography to enhance their looks. The economic incentives for influencers to promote specific products or lifestyles further perpetuate these unrealistic standards, as they are often paid to endorse fitness supplements, workout programs, and diet plans that promise rapid and extreme results ({zotero:ZLDAWWCN}Cataldo et al.).This constant exposure reinforces the perception that these unrealistic standards are the norm, leading to increased pressure on viewers to conform ({zotero:62IDGPYH}Jerónimo and Carraça; {zotero:ZLDAWWCN}Cataldo et al.).

These platforms also enable parasocial relationships, where users form one-sided relationships with influencers. These relationships create a sense of intimacy and trust, making users more susceptible to the messages conveyed by influencers, even if those messages promote unhealthy behaviors. Influencers' perceived closeness and authenticity can make their followers more likely to adopt the unrealistic fitness standards and practices they see promoted online ({zotero:RAAXEATQ}Li et al.).

Societal norms and cultural pressures also drive the creation and consumption of unrealistic fitness content. The emphasis on physical appearance and fitness as markers of success and desirability contributes to the widespread acceptance of these unrealistic standards. Individual psychological factors, such as the need for social comparison and validation, play a role in the impact of unrealistic fitness expectations. People with a high tendency for social comparison are more likely to be negatively affected by exposure to idealized body images ({zotero:MA42UCUJ}Goldstraw and Keegan).

**Recommendations for Interventions**

To mitigate the harms associated with unrealistic fitness expectations, several interventions are recommended:

1. **Regulation of Content**: Enforce stricter guidelines on content promoting unrealistic body standards and harmful fitness practices. Social media platforms should be required to label digitally altered images and provide disclaimers on posts that promote extreme fitness regimes or diet products.  
2. **Media Literacy Education**: Educate young people about the realities of social media content and the risks of social comparison. Schools and parents should provide training on critical thinking and media literacy, helping adolescents understand that what they see online is often not reflective of reality ({zotero:55MS7U8B}Vaterlaus et al.).  
3. **Support Services**: Provide accessible mental health support for those affected by body dissatisfaction and related issues. Counseling services should be made available to help individuals cope with the pressures of social media and develop healthy body image perceptions.  
4. **Modifications in algorithms:** By introducing changes in their algorithms, platforms could reduce the prioritization of harmful content and provide warnings or educational information alongside fitness-related posts ({zotero:RAAXEATQ}Li et al.).

**Conclusion**

The evidence suggests that social media, through the promotion of unrealistic fitness expectations, contributes to significant mental and physical health issues. This underscores the need for increased regulation of harmful content and the promotion of media literacy to help users critically evaluate the fitness content they consume. Parents and educators play a crucial role in guiding young people to engage with social media in a healthy and balanced manner. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach involving policy changes, educational initiatives, and the provision of mental health support to mitigate the negative impacts of unrealistic fitness expectations perpetuated by social media.
